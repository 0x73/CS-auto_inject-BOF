# auto_inject BOF
Finds process from list and injects unattended. Arguments can be specified in the `.cna` to automatically inject into a different process & listener.
- Checks if user privileges allow to open target process, if not tries the next process.
- Uses the same inject method as the `inject` command. Modifications also apply to this inject method.. 


To run a headless client (for unattended injection):

`./agscript [host] [port] [user] [password] [/path/to/script.cna]`

Or run headless interactive and load in manually.
